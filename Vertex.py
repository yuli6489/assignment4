"""
Vertex Class
----------

This class represents an individual Vertex in a Graph. 

Each Vertex consists of the following properties:
    - is_trusted: boolean indicating whether this Vertex is a trusted courier or not
    - edges: A list of vertices connected to this Vertex (adjlist)

The class also supports the following functions:
    - add_edge(Vertex): Adds an edge to the Vertex. 
    - remove_edge(Vertex): Removes an edge from the Vertex
    - get_edges(): Returns a list of all the vertices connected to the Vertex
    - update_status(is_trusted): Updates the status of the Vertex to trusted or not trusted
    - get_is_trusted(): Returns whether the Vertex is trusted or not

Your task is to complete the following functions which are marked by the TODO comment.
You are free to add properties and functions to the class as long as the given signatures remain identical.
Good Luck!
